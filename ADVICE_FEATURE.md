## Backend Implementation

### Endpoint: `POST /GetAdvice`

**Purpose**: Generate personalized agricultural advice using Gemini AI

**Process**:
1. Load `main_data` from `main-variables` collection
2. Load `field_data` from `field-data` collection
3. Load cached calculation results (temperature, demand, rain probability, effectiveness)
4. Locate satellite map screenshot
5. Send all data + image to Gemini AI
6. Return formatted advice (max 150 words)

### Input Data Sources

#### From `main-variables` collection:
- Width (meters)
- Length (meters)
- Plant type
- Latitude
- Longitude

#### From `field-data` collection:
- Water pH
- Water conductivity
- Soil salinity
- Soil moisture

#### From `data` collection (cached):
- Soil temperature (°F)
- Product demand (High/Medium/Low)
- Rain probability (%)
- Crop effectiveness (%)

#### Additional:
- Satellite map image from previous calculation

## AI Prompt Structure

### User Prompt
```
You are an expert agricultural consultant. Based on the following farm data, 
provide a detailed yet concise recommendation on how to improve crop effectiveness.

**Farm Information:**
- Dimensions: 50m x 30m (Total: 1500m²)
- Plant Type: tomate
- Location: Latitude 18.7357, Longitude -70.1627

**Field Measurements:**
Water pH: 6.5
Water Conductivity: 1.5
Soil Salinity: 0.8
Soil Moisture: 45%

**Calculated Metrics:**
- Soil Temperature: 78.5°F
- Product Market Demand: High
- Rain Probability: 35%
- Current Crop Effectiveness: 85%

Provide practical advice on how to improve the crop effectiveness percentage. 
Explain why the current effectiveness is at this level and what specific 
actions can be taken to improve it.

MAXIMUM 150 WORDS. Be specific and actionable.
```

### System Prompt
```
You are an agricultural expert providing actionable advice to farmers.

RULES:
- Maximum 150 words
- Be specific and practical
- Focus on concrete actions
- Explain why effectiveness is at current level
- Suggest 2-3 specific improvements
- Use clear, simple language
- No bullet points, write in paragraph form
- Be encouraging but realistic
```

## Example Advice Output

```
Your 85% crop effectiveness is excellent, driven by optimal soil moisture (45%) 
and favorable pH levels (6.5). The high market demand for tomatoes further 
enhances potential returns. To reach 90%+, focus on three improvements: First, 
monitor soil temperature (78.5°F) as tomatoes prefer 70-75°F; consider shade 
netting during peak heat. Second, with 35% rain probability, implement drip 
irrigation to maintain consistent moisture without waterlogging. Third, the 
moderate conductivity (1.5) suggests room for balanced fertilization—add 
potassium-rich supplements to boost fruit quality. Your location and field 
size are ideal; these targeted adjustments will maximize yield while meeting 
the strong market demand.

## Frontend JavaScript

### Function: `GetAdvice()`

```javascript
async function GetAdvice() {
    // Show modal with loading state
    const modal = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById('adviceModal'));
    modal.show();
    
    // Reset to loading state
    $('#adviceContent').html(`
        <div class="text-center">
            <div class="spinner-border text-primary" role="status">
                <span class="visually-hidden">Loading...</span>
            </div>
            <p class="mt-3">Analyzing your crop data...</p>
        </div>
    `);
    
    try {
        const resp = await tools.PostBack('/GetAdvice', {});
        
        if (resp.status === 1) {
            // Show error
            $('#adviceContent').html(`
                <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
                    <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> ${resp.msg}
                </div>
            `);
            return;
        }
        
        // Display advice
        $('#adviceContent').html(`
            <div class="text-start">
                <p class="lead">${resp.advice}</p>
            </div>
        `);
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error getting advice:', error);
        $('#adviceContent').html(`
            <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
                <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Error getting advice. Please try again.
            </div>
        `);
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Possible Errors

1. **No main variables found**
   - Message: "No main variables found. Please configure initial data first."
   - Solution: User must visit `/VariablesDeInicio` first

2. **Map screenshot not found**
   - Message: "Map screenshot not found. Please calculate data first by loading the main page."
   - Solution: User must let `/Principal` load and call `/Calculate` first

3. **AI generation error**
   - Generic error handling via `tools.msg_err(e)`
   - Modal shows error alert with retry option

## Performance Considerations

### Response Time
- **First Request (Cache MISS)**: 3-8 seconds (AI generation time)
- **Subsequent Requests (Cache HIT)**: ~50ms (instant)
- **Depends on**: 
  - Gemini API response time (first time only)
  - Image processing (first time only)
  - Network latency (first time only)

### Caching Strategy ✨
Advice IS NOW cached in the `data` collection:
- **Cache Key**: Same MD5 hash used for calculations
- **Cache Check**: Looks for existing `advice` field in cached document
- **Cache Save**: Stores advice after generation with timestamp
- **Benefits**:
  - Instant retrieval for same parameters (~50ms)
  - Reduced AI API costs
  - Consistent advice for same conditions
  - Advice tied to calculation data

### Cache Behavior
```
First advice request:
  ├─ Check cache for advice field
  ├─ Not found → Generate with AI (~5 seconds)
  ├─ Save to cache with advice_generated_at
  └─ Return advice

Second advice request (same parameters):
  ├─ Check cache for advice field
  ├─ Found! → Return immediately (~50ms)
  └─ No AI call needed

Parameter changed:
  ├─ New cache key generated
  ├─ Cache miss → Generate new advice
  └─ Process repeats
```

- ✅ `static/scripts/Principal.js` - Added `GetAdvice()` function

### Documentation
- ✅ `ADVICE_FEATURE.md` - This file

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Save Advice History**: Store advice in database with timestamps
2. **Compare Advice**: Show how recommendations change over time
3. **Action Checklist**: Convert advice into actionable steps
4. **Progress Tracking**: Mark which recommendations were implemented
5. **Multi-language**: Translate advice to user's language
6. **Voice Output**: Read advice aloud for accessibility
7. **Share Feature**: Export advice as PDF or send via email
8. **Follow-up**: Schedule reminders to implement recommendations

### A/B Testing Ideas
- Short (100 words) vs Long (150 words) advice
- Bullet points vs Paragraph format
- Technical vs Simple language
- Encouraging vs Direct tone

## API Integration

### Gemini AI Usage
- **Model**: gemini-2.5-flash (as configured in utils/ai/main.py)
- **Input**: Multimodal (text + satellite image)
- **Output**: Plain text advice
- **Token Limit**: ~150 words = ~200 tokens
- **Cost**: Minimal per request

### Rate Limiting
Consider implementing rate limiting if advice is requested too frequently:
```python
# Future: Add rate limiting
# Example: Max 5 advice requests per user per hour
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All data is loaded from database (trusted source)
2. **XSS Prevention**: Advice text is displayed as-is (no HTML injection)
3. **Authentication**: Currently no user auth (single-user system)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented yet (add if abuse occurs)

## Summary
