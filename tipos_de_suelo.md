The main soil types are classified by their texture, with the most common being sandy, which is light and well-drained, but poor in nutrients and water; clay, which is heavy, retains a lot of water and nutrients, but hinders aeration and drainage; silty, which is soft, retains water but not as much as clay, being fertile and well-drained; and loam, which is a balanced mixture of the three previous ones, considered the most fertile and easy to work with for agriculture.
1. Sandy Soil
Characteristics
: Composed mainly of large particles (sand), it is rough to the touch, light and easy to work with.
Advantages
: Drains very well and facilitates root penetration.
Disadvantages
: Does not retain water or nutrients, which are easily lost by leaching.
Use
: Good for plants that prefer well-drained soils.
2. Clay Soil
Characteristics
: Formed by tiny particles, it is heavy, compacts easily and becomes very plastic when wet.
Advantages
: Retains water well and is rich in nutrients.
Disadvantages
: Its high cohesion can hinder root growth and soil aeration, and poor drainage can cause waterlogging.
Use
: Ideal for plants that need high moisture and abundant nutrients.
3. Silty Soil
Characteristics
: Its particles are of an intermediate size between sand and clay, giving it a soft and powdery feel when dry.
Advantages
: It is fertile, retains moisture fairly well and has good drainage.
Disadvantages
: Can erode easily and, although it retains water, it is not as plastic as clay.
Use
: Favors a wide variety of plants, although erosion needs to be monitored.
4. Loam Soil
Characteristics
: It is a balanced mixture of sand, silt and clay, which gives it mixed properties.
Advantages
: It is considered the ideal soil for agriculture, as it is very fertile, retains moisture and nutrients in a balanced way and is easy to work with.
Disadvantages
: Being a mixture, it does not present the disadvantages of pure soils.
Use
: Suitable for a wide range of crops.
